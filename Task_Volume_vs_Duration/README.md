Project: Operational Task Volume vs. Time Impact
Business Question: Which tasks occupy the most operational time? Are high-frequency tasks also the most time-consuming?

Analysis Logic:

Broad Task Coverage: Analyzed 20+ different task types, from "Inventory" to "Delivery".

Metric Correlation: Calculated the relationship between "Task Count" and "Total Duration" to find outliers.

Performance Tuning: Implemented max_bytes_before_external_group_by to handle millions of rows in ClickHouse.

Technical Stack: ClickHouse SQL, Big Data Processing, Operational KPI.
